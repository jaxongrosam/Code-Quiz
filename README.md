# Code-Quiz

## Description
This project was surrounded around practicing our Web API skills within JavaScript, while building HTML and CSS with it. The project itself has unique questions to challenge developers on some basic knowledge, or maybe a trick question here or there, depending on who wrote it. A handful of the topics from this module did not come to me easily, and I struggled to figure some of the concepts out. The project unfortunately is not completed as I could not figure things out in time. However, I look forward to coming back when the topics become clear.
